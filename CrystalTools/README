Crystal Tools

This project was made to give a Window user the ability to interact with Linux CUPS Printing.
It has the ability to VIEW, ADD and DELETE printers from CUPS.
It also has the ability to check if there are files in the print spooler and prompt you to clear the files.

In order to for the program to be functional you need to add a ssh client:
Name, Host, Port, Username, Password and Timeout.
